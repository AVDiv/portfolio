## What is Storion?

Nowadays, Most people live fast moving lives. It is important to be updated, but itâ€™s also required to do it in a short time. News aggregators only group news into 1 place, but it does not analyze those articles to give the readers a proper idea of the dimensions of ideology placed on that space of the news event. This is where a bias-aware news aggregator comes in. 

Storion is a platform that intelligently processes and presents news content to readers by collecting data from many sources, processing them and presenting them on an app.

The platform aggregates news from multiple sources and uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze articles for media bias (for the moment only political bias, & language bias) and summarizes content from various perspectives.

## Key Features

### Bias Detection & Analysis
Storion employs custom-trained NLP models to identify and quantify bias in news articles, providing users with clear indicators of potential ideological slant or manipulation tactics.

### Multi-Source Aggregation
The system collects news from diverse sources across the spectrum, ensuring users have access to various perspectives on the same story.

### Near Real-Time Processing
Using Apache Kafka for data streaming and Prefect for workflow orchestration, Storion processes news articles in real-time, providing up-to-date bias analysis as stories develop.

### Article Clustering
The platform can group related articles by leveraging a custom clustering algorithm (AKA. KENEC) that matches article content based aspects like keywords, NER, and semantic similarity.

### Content Filtration
The system filters out irrelevant content within articles which are in the content as a result of the scraping process (such as Advertisements, etc.), using advanced text processing techniques.

## Technical Approach

The system employs a sophisticated data processing pipeline that:

1. **Ingests** news articles from multiple RSS feeds and APIs
2. **Processes** content through NLP models for bias detection
3. **Stores** articles with metadata in vector databases
4. **Clusters** related articles for comprehensive topic coverage
5. **Presents** results through an intuitive interface showing bias indicators

### Architecture Details

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component (ingestion, processing, analysis) runs as an independent service
- **Event-Driven Design**: Kafka ensures reliable message delivery and processing
- **Vector Search**: Faiss enables efficient similarity search for article clustering
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caches frequently accessed data and analysis results
- **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes manages service scaling and distribution

This approach ensures that users receive not just news, but the context needed to critically evaluate the information they consume.

## Impact

Storion represents a step toward more transparent and democratic news consumption. By making bias visible and providing diverse perspectives, the platform empowers users to:

- Develop more nuanced understanding of complex issues
- Recognize and counter echo chamber effects
- Make more informed decisions based on comprehensive information
- Contribute to a healthier democratic discourse
