Storion is an intelligent news aggregation platform designed to combat misinformation and ideological manipulation by providing users with comprehensive bias analysis and diverse perspectives on current events.

## What is Storion?

In today's digital age, news consumption is heavily influenced by algorithmic filtering and editorial bias. Storion addresses this critical challenge by creating a transparent, bias-aware news ecosystem that empowers users to make informed decisions about the information they consume.

The platform aggregates news from multiple sources and uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze articles for:
- **Ideological bias detection**
- **Sentiment analysis**
- **Source credibility assessment**
- **Perspective diversity**

## Key Features

### Bias Detection & Analysis
Storion employs custom-trained NLP models to identify and quantify bias in news articles, providing users with clear indicators of potential ideological slant or manipulation tactics.

### Multi-Source Aggregation
The system collects news from diverse sources across the political spectrum, ensuring users have access to various perspectives on the same story.

### Real-Time Processing
Using Apache Kafka for data streaming and Prefect for workflow orchestration, Storion processes news articles in real-time, providing up-to-date bias analysis as stories develop.

### Semantic Search & Clustering
Leveraging Faiss vector databases, the platform can group related articles and enable semantic search capabilities, helping users find comprehensive coverage of topics they care about.

### Named Entity Recognition
Advanced NER capabilities help identify key people, organizations, and locations mentioned in articles, providing additional context for bias analysis.

## Technology Stack

Storion is built using a modern, scalable architecture:

- **Python**: Core backend development and ML model implementation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Custom models for bias detection and sentiment analysis
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time data streaming and event processing
- **Prefect**: Workflow orchestration and data pipeline management
- **Faiss**: Vector similarity search for article clustering and recommendations
- **HuggingFace**: Pre-trained models and transformers for NLP tasks
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Entity extraction and analysis

## Impact & Vision

Storion represents a step toward more transparent and democratic news consumption. By making bias visible and providing diverse perspectives, the platform empowers users to:

- Develop more nuanced understanding of complex issues
- Recognize and counter echo chamber effects
- Make more informed decisions based on comprehensive information
- Contribute to a healthier democratic discourse

## Technical Approach

The system employs a sophisticated data processing pipeline that:

1. **Ingests** news articles from multiple RSS feeds and APIs
2. **Processes** content through NLP models for bias detection
3. **Stores** articles with metadata in vector databases
4. **Clusters** related articles for comprehensive topic coverage
5. **Presents** results through an intuitive interface showing bias indicators

This approach ensures that users receive not just news, but the context needed to critically evaluate the information they consume.

## Future Development

Storion continues to evolve with plans for enhanced machine learning models, expanded source coverage, and improved user experience features that make bias-aware news consumption accessible to everyone.
